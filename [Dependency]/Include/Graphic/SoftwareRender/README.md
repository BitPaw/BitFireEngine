# Software Render

## Info
If no graphics card is installed, does not support or had the driver installed, CPU rendering is still very usefull.

The obvios downside is, that we waste potetioal calculating power, as the graphics card is not used at all.<br>
Additionally, we use up alot of time blocking the CPU from doing actual work.
